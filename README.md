Welcome to the Guess My Number Game! This web-based application challenges you to guess a number between 1 and 20.

## Gameplay 

The objective of the game is to guess the correct number chosen by the system. Here's how the game works:

1. The system assigns a random number between 1 and 20.

2. You, as the player, enter your guessed number in the input field provided.

3. If your guessed number matches the system's number, the screen will change to green, indicating that you have won the game. Congratulations! You can then click the "Play Again" button to start a new game.

4. If your guessed number is incorrect, the game will provide you with a hint. The hint will indicate whether your guessed number is higher or lower than the system's number. Use this hint to adjust your next guess.
